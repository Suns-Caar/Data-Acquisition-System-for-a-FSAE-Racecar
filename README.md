# DAQ_FM_ECS

This Repository contains the codes for the Final Version of the Custom Data Acquisition System Based on Xilinx's FPGA SoC Avnet Minized, MINI M4-STM32, and Motec M400 ECU for the season of 2022-2023. 

Minized_noaccel Folder contains the Xilinx SDK project file while the Z_system_wrapper_hw_platform_0 folder is the hardware platform for the FPGA Board. 

This project describes the design and working of a Motorsport Data Acquisition/Logging System, Live Telemetry and Display system developed using the Controller Area Network (CAN) communication protocol as the backbone of the arrangement. A Formula One car hosts over a hundred sensors during each of its races. The Data Acquisition/logging System, although does not directly affect the carâ€™s performance, is an indispensable system when it comes to improving and testing designs. Designers can validate their assumptions and calculations, real-time data during testing can be a safety indicator and it provides insight to the driver about the performance of the vehicle.
